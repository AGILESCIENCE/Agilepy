*'.maplist4'* file
==================

Each line contains a set of maps:

.. code-block::

    <countsMap> <exposureMap> <gasMap> <offaxisangle> <galcoeff> <isocoeff>

where:

 * offaxisangle is in degrees;
 * galcoeff and isocoeff are the coefficients for the galactic and isotropic diffuse components. If positive they will be considered fixed (but see galmode and isomode section).

The file names are separated by a space, so their name should not contain one.
