Tutorial notebooks
******************
There're several categories of tutorial notebooks:

* science_api_tutorial: the most important ones. They show the basic usage of Agilepy to perform a scientific analysis for sources detection. 
* wavelet_analysis_tutorial: they show how to use the Agilepy's wavelet analysis API. 
* engineering_api_tutorial: they show how to use the Agilepy's engineering analysis API. 

Analysis notebooks
******************
These notebooks have been developed to perform sources detection. A template notebook is also provided to speed up the development of a new analysis notebook.
