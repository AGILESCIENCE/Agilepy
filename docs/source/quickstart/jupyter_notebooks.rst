Several Jupyter notebooks are available. You can start a Jupyter server calling:

::

   start_agilepy_notebooks.sh


Tutorial notebooks
******************
There're several categories of tutorial notebooks:

* science_api_tutorial: the most important ones. They show the basic usage of Agilepy to perform a scientific analysis for sources detection. The following notebook are useful example of the use of Agilepy: 

  * `VELA <../_static/notebooks/VELA.html>`_: analysis of Vela region
  * `3C454.3 <../_static/notebooks/3C4543.html>`_: analysis of November's 2010 gamma-ray flare of AGN 3C454.3. Reference paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.5162.pdf
  * `AITOFF <../_static/notebooks/aitoff_maps.html>`_: how to produce a full sky AITOFF projection image.

* wavelet_analysis_tutorial: they show how to use the Agilepy's wavelet analysis API. 
* engineering_api_tutorial: they show how to use the Agilepy's engineering analysis API. 

Analysis notebooks
******************
These notebooks have been developed for internal purposes of the AGILE Team. 
A template notebook is also provided to speed up the development of a new analysis notebook for AGILE Flare Advocate team.
